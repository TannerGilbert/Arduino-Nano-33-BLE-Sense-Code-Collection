The Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense is an evolution of the traditional Arduino Nano, which comes with a series of embedded sensors. In the subfolder you can find information and code examples for each sensor on the Arduino Nano 33 Ble Sense.
* [9 axis inertial sensor](LSM9DS1/): what makes this board ideal for wearable devices
* [humidity, and temperature sensor](HTS221/): to get highly accurate measurements of the environmental conditions
* [barometric sensor](LPS22HB/): you could make a simple weather station
* [microphone](MP34DT05-A/): to capture and analyse sound in real time
* [gesture, proximity, light color and light intensity sensor](APDS9960/) : estimate the roomâ€™s luminosity, but also whether someone is moving close to the board
